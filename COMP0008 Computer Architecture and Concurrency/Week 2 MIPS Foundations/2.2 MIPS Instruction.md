## 🧠 MIPS Registers

- MIPS32 has **32 registers**: `$0` to `$31`, each **32-bit**
    
- `$0` is **always 0**
    
- Registers serve different roles (e.g. `$sp`, `$ra`, etc.)

### ✅ MIPS特点：

- Unlike x86, MIPS only works on **registers**, not directly on memory.
    
- **ISA is simpler**, but **needs more instructions**.

### 📖 Example:

```
Mem[0x1001000] += Mem[0x1001004]
→ Steps in MIPS:
1. Load Mem[0x1001000] into reg
2. Load Mem[0x1001004] into reg
3. Add regs
4. Store result back to Mem[0x1001000]
```

## ⚙️ MIPS = RISC Processor

- **RISC** = Reduced Instruction Set Computer  
    → Simple, regular instructions  
    → Fewer instruction types

### 🧱 Instruction Format:

```
| opcode (6 bits) | arguments (26 bits) |
```

- Example:
    
    ```
    0x3c011001
    0b001111 00001 00000 0000000000000001
    ↑      ↑
    LUI   $1, 0x1001
    ```
    
- `lui` = Load Upper Immediate  
    → Loads high 16 bits of a register

## 🧾 MIPS Instruction Types

![[MIPS Instruction.png]]

MIPS has **3 instruction types**:


### 🅡 R-Type

![[R-ithmetic instructions.png]]

> Register-to-register operations

- Format: `op rs rt rd shamt funct`
    
- Used for **arithmetic**, **logic**, **shifts**
    
- ✅ Examples:
    

```asm
add $8, $1, $2        # $8 = $1 + $2
sub $12, $6, $3       # $12 = $6 - $3
and $5, $4, $7        # bitwise AND
or  $2, $2, $10       # bitwise OR
sll $9, $2, 4         # shift left logical
slt $11, $3, $4       # set if $3 < $4
```

---

### 🅘 I-Type

![[I-mmediate instructions.png]]

> Immediate / memory / branch operations

- Format: `op rs rt imm`
    
- ✅ Examples:
    

```asm
addi $15, $15, -1     # $15 = $15 - 1
andi $8, $8, 0xFF     # bitwise AND with constant
ori  $9, $0, 0x1234   # load const into $9
lw   $2, 4($3)        # load word from memory
sw   $5, 8($6)        # store word to memory
beq  $10, $14, 0x0002 # branch if equal
bne  $1, $0, -4       # branch if not equal
```

---

### 🅙 J-Type

> Jump operations

- Format: `op target`
    
- ✅ Examples:
    

```asm
j   0x00400050        # jump to address
jal 0x0040007c        # jump and link (function call)
```

---

### 🧠 Tip:

- Use `lui + ori` to load a full 32-bit constant:
    

```asm
lui $t0, 0x1234
ori $t0, $t0, 0x5678  # $t0 = 0x12345678
```
