## 🧮 Decimal System

- Uses **base 10**, digits: `0-9`
    
- Can represent:
    
    - Fractions: `1.7 = 1×10⁰ + 7×10⁻¹`
        
    - Rationals: `7/6 = 1.1̅₁₀` (every rational = finite/repeating decimal)
        
- Can appear in different digit notations
    
- Example: `176₁₀` (subscript 10)
    
- **Not the only number system**

## 💻 Binary System

- **Base 2**, digits: `0` and `1` (bit)
    
- Example:  
    `1101₂ = 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 13₁₀`
    
- Multiply by `10₂` = append 0  
    e.g. `1101₂ × 10₂ = 11010₂`
    
- Common prefix: `0b`, e.g. `0b1101`
    
- Natural for computers

## ➕ Binary Arithmetic

- Same rules as decimal
    
- Addition:  
    `1101₂ = 13`, `0110₂ = 6`  
    `1101 + 0110 = 10011₂ = 19₁₀`
    
- Multiplication (like long mul.):  
    `1101₂ × 0110₂ = 1001110₂ = 78₁₀`

## ✌ 2's Complement Representation

### ✅ Why Use It?

- Eliminates `+0` / `−0` problem
    
- Makes **addition/subtraction** simpler
    
- Widely used in computers for signed integers
    

---

### 🧮 How to Compute 2's Complement:

1. **Write binary**
    
2. **Invert all bits** (0 ↔ 1) → _1's complement_
    
3. **Add 1**
    

```text
Example: -5 (8-bit)
+5 = 0000 0101  
Invert → 1111 1010  
Add 1 → 1111 1011
```

### 🧠 Notes:

- MSB (most significant bit 最高有效位) = **sign bit**(符号位):  
    `0` = positive, `1` = negative
    
- Range (for n bits):  
    `−2ⁿ⁻¹` to `2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1`  
    → e.g., 8-bit: `−128 to 127`
    
- Overflow occurs **if signs of inputs are the same**, but result sign is different

## ⚠️ Overflow in 2's Complement

Overflow happens when:
- The result is **too large/small** to fit in fixed bits.
- **Signs don’t make sense** after the operation.

### ❌ Could Overflow:
- ✅ (neg) + (neg) → Too negative
- ✅ (pos) + (pos) → Too positive

### ✅ Safe (No Overflow):
- (pos) + (neg) → Result stays in range
- (pos) − (pos) → Same as (pos) + (−pos), still safe

🧠 Tip:
Overflow only happens when:
- **Adding two numbers with the same sign**, and
- The result has the **opposite sign**
-

## 🔢 2's Complement Ranges

|Bits|Min Value|Max Value|
|---|---|---|
|8|**−128**|**+127**|
|16|**−32,768**|**+32,767**|
|32|**−2,147,483,648**|**+2,147,483,647**|
|64|**−9,223,372,036,854,775,808**|**+9,223,372,036,854,775,807**|

---

### 🧠 Remember:

- Range formula:
    
    ```
    Min = -2^(n-1)  
    Max =  2^(n-1) - 1
    ```
    
- Because MSB is for sign, only `n−1` bits are used for magnitude.
