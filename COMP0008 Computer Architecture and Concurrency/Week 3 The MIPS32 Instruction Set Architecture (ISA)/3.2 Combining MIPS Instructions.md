## 🧮 Bit Manipulation Example (MIPS)

### 🧠 Goal:

Extract **`rs` field** from a 32-bit instruction stored in register `$4`

---

### 📌 Given:

```text
$4 = 10101101111010001000000000000000
           ↑    rs field is bits [25:21] = 01111
```

We want:

```text
$6 = 00000000000000000000000000001111  → rs = $15
```

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Create a bitmask

```asm
lui $5, 0x03E0         # 0x03E00000 = mask for bits [25:21]
and $6, $4, $5         # $6 = $4 & mask → keeps only bits 25–21
```

Intermediate result:

```text
$6 = 00000001111000000000000000000000
```

---

### Step 2: Shift right to align

```asm
srl $6, $6, 21         # Right shift by 21 bits to bring rs to LSB
```

Final result:

```text
$6 = 00000000000000000000000000001111
```

---

## 💡 Summary

|Operation|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`lui` + `mask`|isolate bits 25–21 (rs field)|
|`and`|clear unwanted bits|
|`srl`|align extracted value|

## 🔍 Comparing Registers with Constants

Used to test conditions like:  
**Is `$4 < 10`?**

---

### ✅ Use Set-If-Less-Than Instructions

#### 🧮 Signed Comparison

```asm
slti $t0, $4, 10
```

> If `$4 < 10` (signed), then `$t0 = 1`, else `$t0 = 0`

---

#### 🧮 Unsigned Comparison

```asm
sltiu $t0, $4, 10
```

> If `$4 < 10` (unsigned), then `$t0 = 1`, else `$t0 = 0`

---

### 🧠 Then What?

Use **`beq` / `bne` with `$zero`** to branch:

```asm
bne $t0, $zero, label   # if condition true, jump
```

---

### 💡 Summary

|Instruction|Type|Compares...|
|---|---|---|
|`slti`|Signed|`rs < imm`|
|`sltiu`|Unsigned|`rs < imm`|

## 🧮 MIPS: Multiple Ways to Compute an Average

We want to compute:
```c
average=(x+y)/2
```

---

### ✅ Version 1: Simple Method (Safe for Small Values)

```asm
li $8, 173
li $9, 191

addu $10, $8, $9    # $10 = x + y
srl  $10, $10, 1    # $10 = (x + y) / 2
```

**🔸 Problem:**  
Can cause **overflow** if `x + y` > `2³² - 1`

---

### ✅ Version 2: Overflow-Safe Method Using Bitwise Trick

Uses identity:
```c
x + y = 2 × (x & y) + (x ^ y)
```

```c
average(x, y) = (x & y) + ((x ^ y) >> 1);
```

```asm
and $10, $8, $9       # $10 = x & y
xor $11, $8, $9       # $11 = x ^ y
srl $11, $11, 1       # $11 = (x ^ y) / 2
addu $10, $10, $11    # $10 = avg
```

This version avoids overflow when `x + y` exceeds `2³²`

---

### 🧠 Bitwise Math Behind Version 2

|Expression|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`x & y`|common bits, "safely average"|
|`x ^ y`|difference between x and y|
|`>> 1`|divide difference by 2|
|add together|total average|
