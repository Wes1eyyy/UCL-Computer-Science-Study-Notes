# üßµ Concurrency in Modern Systems

## ‚úÖ The Concurrency Story So Far

- **Modern hardware enables true parallelism**
    
    - Threads can run simultaneously on different cores.
        
- **Thread interactions can lead to non-deterministic, unwanted results**
    
    - Outcomes vary due to hardware, OS, workload, interrupts, etc.
        
    - These interactions are modeled by **concurrency abstraction**.
        
- **To guarantee correctness**, we must **forbid some interleavings**
    
    - Not all interleavings of thread execution are safe or valid.

## üåê A Simple Multithreaded Web Service Example

### Use Case: A Factorization Server
![[stateless service.png]]

- The server receives integer requests (e.g. `X`) from clients and returns factor lists.
    

### Implementation Goal

- **Assign one thread per client request**
    
    - Boosts server responsiveness and performance.
        

### Thread Memory Layout

- **Shared:**
    
    - Code, data, and heap (same for all threads)
        
- **Private per thread:**
    
    - Registers and stack
        

---

### üß† **Thread Safety & Statelessness: Summary Notes**

#### üîí **Thread Safety (Definition)**

- A program is **thread safe** if it **never enters an invalid state**, regardless of how threads interact.
    
- Thread safety implies **no race conditions**, meaning:
    
    - Multiple threads accessing shared resources won‚Äôt cause incorrect behavior.
        
- Thread safety can be formalized using:
    
    - **Pre-conditions**, **post-conditions**, and **invariants**.
        

#### ‚úÖ **Practical Definition of Thread Safety (in this module)**

- A class is considered thread-safe if:
    
    - It produces the **same set of outputs** regardless of the **number** or **timing** of threads accessing it.
        

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Stateless Services**

- A **stateless** service does **not retain** any data or state between client requests.
    
- All variables used in request handling are **method-local**, and thus:
    
    - Stored in **each thread‚Äôs private stack**, not shared.
        
    - **Invisible and inaccessible** to other threads.
        

#### ‚úÖ **Why Stateless Services Are Thread-Safe**

- Example: `SimpleFactorizer` servlet.
    
    - Each invocation of `service()` creates local variables (`i`, `factors`) in the thread‚Äôs stack.
        
    - No shared mutable state is accessed or modified.
        
- Since no data is shared across threads ‚Üí **no interference** ‚Üí **thread safe** by design.

# Iteration 2: Adding Application-Level Caching

## Motivation

- **Factorization is an expensive operation.**
    
- We want to avoid recomputing the factors of a number if we have already recently computed it.
    

## Approach

- **Idea**: Remember the result of the last factorization.
    
- **Implementation**: Add **instance fields** to the servlet:
    
    ```java
    private BigInteger lastNumber;
    private BigInteger[] lastFactors;
    ```
    

## Code Sketch

```java
public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp) {
    BigInteger i = extract(req);
    BigInteger[] factors = null;
    
    if (i.equals(lastNumber)) {
        factors = lastFactors.clone(); // cache hit
    }
    
    if (factors == null) {
        factors = factorize(i); // cache miss
        lastNumber = i;
        lastFactors = factors;
    }
    
    encodeInResponse(resp, factors);
}
```

## Problem: Is CachingFactorizer Thread Safe?

- **Answer**: No, it is **not thread-safe**.
    
- **Reason**:
    
    - `lastNumber` and `lastFactors` are shared between threads.
        
    - Threads might read and write these shared variables **concurrently**.
        
    - **Post-conditions are not guaranteed**:
        
        - Post-condition #1: `lastFactors` must be the factors of `lastNumber`.
            
        - Post-condition #2: Each response must encode the correct factors for its request.
            

## Example Race Conditions

- **Race 1**:
    
    - Thread A sets `lastNumber = X`,
        
    - Thread B sets `lastNumber = Y`,
        
    - Then A sets `lastFactors = factorize(X)`.
        
    - Result: `lastNumber = Y`, but `lastFactors = factorize(X)` (inconsistent pair).
        
- **Race 2**:
    
    - Thread A checks `i.equals(lastNumber)`,
        
    - Thread B modifies `lastFactors`,
        
    - Then A reads incorrect `lastFactors`.
        
    - Result: A sends back the wrong factors to the client.
        

## Key Takeaways

- **Shared mutable state** must be protected when accessed by multiple threads.
    
- **Need synchronization**(ÂêåÊ≠•) to coordinate access to shared variables.
    
- **Compound actions** (like checking and updating `lastNumber` and `lastFactors`) must be made **atomic** to ensure correctness.
    

---

# Iteration 3: Adding Synchronization

## Goal

- Solve the race conditions that arose in Iteration 2 by **coordinating threads**.
    
- Ensure that access to shared variables (`lastNumber` and `lastFactors`) is **atomic** and **thread-safe**.
    

## Implementation

- **Synchronize** the `service()` method:
    
    ```java
    public synchronized void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp) {
        BigInteger i = extract(req);
        BigInteger[] factors = null;
        if (i.equals(lastNumber)) {
            factors = lastFactors.clone();
        }
        if (factors == null) {
            factors = factorize(i);
            lastNumber = i;
            lastFactors = factors;
        }
        encodeInResponse(resp, factors);
    }
    ```
    
- **Effect of synchronization**:
    
    - Only **one thread** can execute the `service()` method at any given time.
        
    - When a thread enters the synchronized method, it **acquires a lock** on the object.
        
    - Other threads must **wait** until the lock is released.
        

## Analysis

### ‚úÖ Pros

- Solves the **race condition**(Á´ûÊÄÅÊù°‰ª∂) problem.
    
- Ensures thread safety for access and update of shared variables.
    

### ‚ùå Cons

- **Performance bottleneck**:
    
    - Only one thread at a time can factorize numbers, even though factorization is an **expensive operation**.
        
    - The server becomes almost as slow as a **single-threaded application**.
        
    - We lose most benefits of multi-threading and caching.
        

---

# Iteration 4: Better Locking

## Goal

- Avoid serializing the expensive `factorize()` operation.
    
- Only synchronize when accessing **shared variables** (`lastNumber` and `lastFactors`).
    
- Improve **concurrency** and **throughput** while maintaining **thread safety**.
    

---

## Improved `service()` Method

```java
public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp) {
    BigInteger i = extract(req);
    BigInteger[] factors = null;

    synchronized(this) {
        if (i.equals(lastNumber))
            factors = lastFactors.clone();
    }

    if (factors == null) {
        factors = factorize(i);

        synchronized(this) {
            lastNumber = i;
            lastFactors = factors;
        }
    }

    encodeInResponse(resp, factors);
}
```

---

## Key Changes

- **Synchronized blocks** are used **only** when reading or writing `lastNumber` and `lastFactors`.
    
- **The expensive `factorize()` computation is outside the synchronized blocks**, allowing multiple threads to perform it in parallel.
    

---

## Analysis

### ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Thread safety** is preserved: all access to shared state is properly synchronized.
    
- **Higher concurrency**: multiple threads can factorize numbers simultaneously without blocking each other.
    

### ‚ùå Potential Drawbacks

- **Increased code complexity**: developers must be careful not to miss necessary synchronization.
    
- **Risk of future maintenance issues**: more fine-grained locking makes the code harder to modify safely.
    

---

# Iteration 5: Possible Refactoring

## Motivation

- Improve **readability** and **maintainability**.
    
- Separate synchronization for **read** and **write** operations.
    
- Avoid manual `synchronized` blocks scattered in the main logic.
    

---

## Refactored Methods

### Reading (Get Cached Factors)

```java
private synchronized BigInteger[] getSavedFactors(BigInteger i) {
    if (i.equals(lastNumber))
        return lastFactors.clone();
    return null;
}
```

- Synchronized reading.
    
- Returns a **clone** to prevent external modification.
    

---

### Writing (Update Cache)

```java
private synchronized void saveState(BigInteger i, BigInteger[] factors) {
    lastNumber = i;
    lastFactors = factors;
}
```

- Synchronized writing.
    
- Updates both `lastNumber` and `lastFactors` atomically.
    

---

## Key Points

- **Synchronization is hidden** inside small methods.
    
- **Main service logic** becomes cleaner and easier to follow.
    
- Easier to maintain or modify synchronization strategy later.
    
- Reduces risk of forgetting to synchronize.

# Principles for Using `synchronized` (based on 5 Iterations)

## 1. **When synchronization is necessary**

- If **shared mutable state** is accessed by multiple threads, synchronization is needed.
    
- Typical case: **instance fields** shared by threads (e.g., `lastNumber`, `lastFactors`).
    

---

## 2. **Avoid over-synchronization**

- Synchronizing the **entire method** (Iteration 3) ensures thread safety, **but**:
    
    - It **blocks** all threads unnecessarily.
        
    - Even expensive, independent computations (e.g., factorizing) are serialized ‚ûî **Performance bottleneck**.
        

---

## 3. **Synchronize only critical sections**

- Only **guard** access to **shared mutable data** (Iteration 4).
    
- Leave **independent computations** (like factorization) outside the synchronized block.
    
- This allows **parallelism** where possible and **synchronization** where needed.
    

---

## 4. **Encapsulate synchronization**

- Refactor synchronized operations into **small private methods** (Iteration 5):
    
    - `getSavedFactors()` ‚Üí synchronized read
        
    - `saveState()` ‚Üí synchronized write
        
- Keeps the **main service code clean** and **easier to maintain**.
    

---

## 5. **General Best Practices Summary**

|Principle|Why|
|:--|:--|
|Minimize synchronized scope|Avoid unnecessary blocking, maximize parallelism.|
|Synchronize access to shared state only|Protect only what needs protection.|
|Prefer synchronized helper methods|Cleaner and safer code organization.|
|Avoid holding locks during slow operations|Prevent system-wide slowdowns.|
|Clone or copy shared data when reading|Prevent concurrent modifications.|

---

# Final Key Takeaway

‚úÖ **Synchronize small, focused areas** that involve shared mutable state.  
‚úÖ **Don't lock slow or independent work** (like computation).  
‚úÖ **Refactor synchronization** into dedicated methods for clarity and safety.
