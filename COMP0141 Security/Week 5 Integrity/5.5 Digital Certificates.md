# Digital Certificates & PKI 🛡️

## Let’s Encrypt (免费证书工具)

- Automates HTTPS certificate issuance (自动化证书签发)
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Register + provide public key
        
    2. Request certificate with domain identifiers
        
    3. Solve challenge (e.g., HTTP file check)
        
    4. CA verifies, issues certificate

## HTTPS Adoption (HTTPS 普及)

- Let’s Encrypt boosted global HTTPS use
    
- Today: HTTPS is the norm (不是例外)
    

---

## X.509 Certificates (证书标准)

- Defines certificate format + chain
    
- Includes: subject, issuer, validity, public key, signature
    
- Uses certificate chain: Root CA → Intermediate CA → Site cert

## Root Certificates (根证书)

- Stored in OS/browser trust store
    
- Basis of PKI trust model
    

---

## PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure 公钥基础设施)

- Trust system using CA-signed certificates
    
- Needs careful key distribution (CA keys)
    
- Certificate Transparency (CT) reduces blind trust

## Public-Key Cryptography (公钥密码学优势)

✅ Secrecy without shared secrets → anyone encrypts to Bob  
✅ Integrity without key exchange → digital signatures  
✅ Small key distribution → only distribute CA keys

Disadvantage: complex setup, strong assumptions
