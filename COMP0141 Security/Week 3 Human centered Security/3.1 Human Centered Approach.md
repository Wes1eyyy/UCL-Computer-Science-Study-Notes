# People & Security – Core Notes

## 1. Human-Centered Security (以人为本的安全)

- **Security is a process, not a product** (安全是过程，不是产品)
- Design must account for **human limitations** (人类局限性) like memory, biases
- Avoid asking users to do what they **cannot reliably do**
- Find **opportunities to include users** in the security process

---

## 2. Socio-Technical Thinking (社会-技术系统思维)

- Systems are both **SOCIAL** (e.g. people, workplace) and **TECHNICAL** (e.g. encryption, authentication)
- Good design lies in the **overlap** between social and technical

---

## 3. Users Are Not the Weakest Link (用户不是最弱一环)

- Users prioritize **task completion** over security (任务优先于安全)
- Users often lack **awareness or guidance** (缺乏意识或指引)
- Poor usability leads to **insecure workarounds** (非安全性替代方案)

---

## 4. Users Are Not the Enemy (用户不是敌人)

- Users **care** about security but are constrained
- Security policies often **conflict with actual work**
- Users should be treated as **partners** not threats

---

## 5. Security Managers & Organisational Issues

- **Security managers (SMs)** often can’t engage users due to structure
- Leads to **distrust**, rigid policies, and a **negative feedback loop** (负面反馈循环)
- Policies are often **ineffective** and not enforced

---

## 6. Security Policy Problems

- Too **complex**, not usable
- Created in an **ideal world**, not grounded in real use
- Cause users to **bypass security**

---

## 7. Compliance Factors (合规影响因素)

Key influences (from studies):

- **Awareness** (意识)
- **Response cost** (执行代价)
- **Perceived risk** (风险感知)
- **Self-efficacy** (自我效能感)
- **Social pressure** (社会压力)
- **Habits** (习惯)

---

## 8. Password Behavior

### Security professional’s view:
- No reuse
- Complex, long passwords
- No writing down

### Typical user’s reality:
- Reuse to **remember**
- Write down or share due to **necessity**
- Use short/easy passwords for **task efficiency**

---

## 9. Usability vs Security

- Tools like **PGP** are secure but **unusable**
- Tools like **WhatsApp** are secure *and* usable → widely adopted

---

## 10. Usability Principles (可用性五原则)

From **Nielsen Norman Group**:

1. **Effectiveness** (准确性)
2. **Efficiency** (效率)
3. **Engagement** (愉悦感)
4. **Error tolerance** (容错性)
5. **Ease of learning** (易学性)

---

## 11. Helping Users 'Do' Security

- Understand work “**in the wild**” (真实环境中)
- **Simplify tasks**, lower cost of secure behavior
- Use **affordances** (设计暗示), e.g., PUSH signs
- Provide clear **feedback** (反馈) on user actions

---

## 12. Human-Centered Design (人本设计)

- People should be **the center of the design**
- Use **observation, testing, ideation** cycles
- Leads to fewer errors, better adoption
- Critique: Can design **exclude** unintended users?
