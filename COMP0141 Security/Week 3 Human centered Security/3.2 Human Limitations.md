# People & Security – Human Limitations

## 1. Human Limitations (人类局限性)

- Security policies often **ignore human limits**.
- Asking users to never write passwords, remember complex ones, and change them monthly is **mission impossible**.

---

## 2. Memory Limitations (记忆局限)

- **Short-term memory**: can hold ~7 chunks of info, fades after 20–30 seconds.
- Security tasks like “enter the 1st, 4th, 10th character” are **hard to recall**.
- **Long-term memory** (程序性记忆): forms habits – both good and bad.

---

## 3. Cognitive Biases (认知偏差)

Biases that affect security behavior:

- **Optimism bias** (乐观偏差): *"It won’t happen to me."*
- **Anchoring bias** (锚定偏差): *"I’ve done it this way before."*
- **Consensus bias** (一致性偏差): *"Nobody uses strong passwords."*
- **Hyperbolic discounting** (延迟折扣): *"I’ll fix it later."*

## 4. Unsecure Wi-Fi (不安全Wi-Fi)

- People know the risk, but use it to **save mobile data**.
- Shows **optimism bias** – users underestimate their personal risk.

---

## 5. Optimistic Security Managers (安全经理的过度乐观)

- Security managers (SMs) think their **firm is safer** than others.
- Reason: **illusion of control** (控制错觉).
- Higher illusion → higher optimism → possible blind spots.

---

## 6. Anchoring Effect & 2FA

- Users repeat previous decisions.
- **Those who’ve used 2FA** are more likely to keep using it.
- Early decisions create a **mental anchor** (心理锚点).

---

## 7. Security Warnings (安全警告局限)

Problems with current warnings:

- Users become **desensitized** (麻木) due to overuse.
- Too many **false positives**.
- Users lack clear **mental models** (心智模型) to understand risks.

---

## 8. Limited Attention (注意力有限)

- People only notice what they **focus on**.
- Example: UCL header change goes unnoticed.
- In emails, users focus on **content**, not on **phishing warnings**.

> “We perceive and remember only what gets focused attention.”  
> — Simons & Chabris (1999, Gorilla experiment)

## 9. Design Implication

- Security messages must **compete for attention**.
- Poor design = ignored warnings = greater vulnerability.
