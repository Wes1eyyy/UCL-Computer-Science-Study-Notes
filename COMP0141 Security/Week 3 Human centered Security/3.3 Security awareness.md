# People & Security – User Awareness & Behaviour

## 1. User Awareness (用户意识)

- Refers to users’ **understanding** of security risks and **ability to act**.
- Platforms: **CybSafe**, **Cyber Aware**, **BBC Webwise**, **NCSC**, etc.
- Awareness alone is **not enough** – it must lead to **behaviour change**.

## 2. MINDSPACE Model (行为影响模型)

Used to design effective awareness interventions:

| Principle     | Meaning                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Messenger** (传递者) | People respond better to trusted or authoritative sources |
| **Incentives** (激励) | Responses shaped by rewards or loss aversion          |
| **Norms** (规范)      | We copy what others do                               |
| **Defaults** (默认)   | We follow preset options                             |
| **Salience** (显著性) | We notice what’s new and relevant                    |
| **Priming** (潜意识激活) | Behaviour influenced by subconscious cues         |
| **Affect** (情绪)       | Emotions shape actions                              |
| **Commitments** (承诺) | We stick to public promises                         |
| **Ego** (自我)         | We act to maintain self-image                       |

## 3. Awareness Considerations (意识实施考量)

- Do users feel **in control**? (控制感)
- Are they **motivated** to act securely?
- Do they **know what to do** and **how to do it**?
- Cultural factors matter (e.g., **collectivism vs individualism**).
- Systems must be **usable**, or awareness won’t translate into action.
- Ideally, users are **self-motivated**.

---

## 4. Motivation Model (动机行为模型)

Ask:

- Are users **motivated** to do the right thing?
- Are they **able** to do the right thing?
- Are they **prompted** effectively?

Consider sustainability:

- How long does motivation last?
- Can users continue to act safely?
- Are prompts consistently effective?

## 5. Simulated Phishing Attacks (模拟钓鱼攻击)

- Send fake phishing emails to test awareness.
- Aims:
  - Identify vulnerable staff
  - Train based on results

**Effectiveness:**

- Can reduce risk **short-term**
- Only **limited types** can be tested
- May place **unfair burden** on staff

**Appropriateness:**

- May increase **distrust**
- Can damage **goodwill** if perceived as deceptive

---

## 6. Sanctioning Poor Behaviour (惩罚 vs 威慑)

- Reinfelder et al. (2019): SMs feel policies are **unenforceable**.
- **Deterrence** (威慑): discourage bad behaviour by increasing perceived cost.
- But:
  - Can lead to **non-reporting**
  - Can create **distrust**, harm security culture

---

## Key Insight

> Awareness must be **usable, supportive, and behaviourally informed** to be effective.
