# People & Security – Inclusive Security

## 1. Inclusive Security (包容性安全)

- Human-centred design must consider **accessibility** (可达性) as well as **usability** (可用性).
- One design may work for some, but **exclude others** (e.g. disabled, elderly).
- ~17.7% of UK population have a disability (2021); 1 in 6 people are 65+.

## 2. Accessible / Universal Design (无障碍 / 通用设计)

- **Accessible design**: for people with disabilities (为残障人士设计).
- **Universal design**: for **everyone**; often helps all users.
- According to WCAG 2.1 (W3C), design must be:

  1. **Perceivable** (可感知) – information must be seen or heard
  2. **Operable** (可操作) – interface must be navigable
  3. **Understandable** (可理解) – content must make sense
  4. **Robust** (稳健性) – compatible with assistive tech

## 3. Disabilities & Security (残障与安全)

- Disabilities create **complex needs**.
- Issues include:
  - **Dyslexia** (阅读障碍): hard to create/remember passwords
  - **Motor impairments** (动作障碍): difficult to type or tap
  - **Colour blindness** (色盲): warnings may not be visible (e.g., red)

## 4. Existing Accessibility Features (现有辅助功能)

- Common tools: Apple VoiceOver, Microsoft Live Captions
- Problems:
  - Spellcheckers fail in password fields
  - Screen readers may leak sensitive info
  - OCR fails on CAPTCHAs (验证码)

---

## 5. Accessibility in Authentication (认证中的可达性)

- **Biometrics** (生物识别): can reduce cognitive load
- Problems:
  - Setup is complex for some users
  - **Involuntary movements** (非自主动作) affect facial recognition

---

## 6. Age-Related Factors (年龄因素)

- Older adults face **physical & cognitive decline** (身体与认知退化)
- Dependent on:
  - Support from others
  - Skill levels
  - Keeping up with evolving security threats

---

## 7. Older Adults and 2FA (老年人与双因子认证)

Barriers to 2FA use:

- Lack of technical knowledge
- Privacy concerns
- Hardware/software compatibility
- Difficulty using small physical devices (e.g. USB keys)

---

## 8. Key Takeaway

> Inclusive security = **Security + Usability + Accessibility**

Design must work for **everyone**, not just the “average” user.
