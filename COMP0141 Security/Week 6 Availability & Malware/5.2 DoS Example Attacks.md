# Week 5 – DoS Example Attacks

## DNS DoS Attacks (2006, Bluesecurity)

- DNS runs on UDP port 53 (UDP协议53端口).
    
- Attack: flood victim ISP with DNS requests, using random source IP (伪造源IP).
    
- Impact: takes out DNS server → affects many sites.

## Root-level DNS Attacks

- Feb 6, 2007:
    
    - Botnet attack on 13 root servers.
        
    - Lasted 2.5 hours, no crashes, but g-root (US Dept.) and i-root (ICANN) slowed badly.
        
- Oct 2002:
    
    - Attack disabled 9 of 13 TLD servers.

## DNS DoS Solutions

- General DDoS solutions require redesign.
    
- DoS-resistant DNS design:
    
    - **CoDoNS** (Cooperative Domain Name System, 协作域名系统).
        
    - P2P DNS: share load, simple updates, backward compatible.

## DoS via Route Hijacking

- YouTube 2008 (Feb):
    
    - Pakistan telecom advertised BGP route for YouTube’s IP block.
        
    - Routing took most-specific prefix → global traffic sent to Pakistan.
        
    - Outage fixed in ~2 hours.

## Mirai Botnet (2016)

- IoT devices (物联网设备) infected, formed massive botnet.
    
- Attacks blocked US access to Twitter, Netflix, Airbnb, etc.
    
- Example of large-scale DDoS from embedded devices.

## Github Attack (2018)

- Memcached amplification attack (memcached放大攻击):
    
    - Attack without needing botnet.
        
    - Uses “ask for full list” to trigger large reply flood.

## Dyn DDoS (2016)

- Target: Dyn (DNS provider), caused huge Internet outages.
    
- Botnet included millions of insecure IoT devices.
    
- Raised questions: how to regulate IoT security?

## Types of DoS Attacks

|Category|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Network Level Device|Christmas Tree packets|Exhaust hardware resources.|
|OS Level|Ping of Death, Teardrop|Exploit OS protocol handling.|
|Application Level|Finger Bomb|Overload app-level services.|
|Data Flood|Smurf, UDP Echo|Send massive data to exhaust bandwidth or CPU.|
|Protocol Feature Attack|SYN flood, DNS corruption|Exploit protocol bugs (e.g., spoofing IP, corrupting DNS cache).|
