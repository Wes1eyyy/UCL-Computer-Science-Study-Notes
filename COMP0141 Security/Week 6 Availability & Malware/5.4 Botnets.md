## 🕸 Botnets Summary (COMP141 Week 5)

### What is a Bot?

- A bot (僵尸, drone) = compromised machine (被攻破的机器) remotely controlled by attacker.
    
- Origin: IRC automation tools.
    
- Key features:
    
    - Remote control (远程控制).
        
    - Can run various commands (执行多种命令).
        
    - Joins large networks → botnet (僵尸网络).
        
    - Installed via trojan or worm (木马或蠕虫).

### Command and Control (C&C, 指挥与控制)

- Attacker uses a C&C server to control bots.
    
- Bots report status + receive commands.
    
- C&C is flexible (灵活) but is a single point of failure (单点失效).
    

---

### Common Bot Commands

- Steal data: emails, keys, passwords (窃取数据).
    
- Keylogging (记录按键), sniffing traffic (嗅探流量), screenshots (截屏).
    
- Kill antivirus or rivals (杀掉杀毒软件).
    
- Set up proxy for spam (设置代理发垃圾邮件).
    
- Download + execute files (下载与执行文件).
    
- Update commands (更新指令).
    

---

### C&C Architectures

- Push style (推送式): C&C sends commands.
    
- Pull style (拉取式): bot asks C&C.
    
- Centralized C&C:
    
    - Multiple servers (多个服务器).
        
    - Partitioned botnets (分片僵尸网络).
        
- P2P C&C:
    
    - Bots communicate in P2P network (点对点网络).
        
    - Harder to trace (更难追踪), but noisier (噪声更大).
        

---

### Bullet-Proof Hosting (防弹主机)

- Malicious ISPs ignore abuse reports (无视滥用报告).
    
- De-peering (撤销互联) is hard, needs law enforcement.
    

---

### Torpig Botnet Example

- Uses Mebroot rootkit (引导区 rootkit).
    
- Domain flux (域名轮换) algorithm for C&C.
    
- UCSB researchers reverse-engineered (逆向工程) and hijacked (劫持) it.
    
- Collected:
    
    - 70GB data from 52k machines.
        
    - ~1.2 million passwords, 1.2 million emails.
        

---

### Botnet Defense

- Attack C&C infrastructure (攻击指挥基础设施).
    
    - Take down IRC, blackhole routes.
        
- Honeypots (蜜罐):
    
    - Fake vulnerable systems.
        
    - Log bot behavior, study botmaster.

✅ **Key takeaway**:  
Botnets are powerful, flexible, but depend on C&C. Defenses target C&C or use deception traps.
