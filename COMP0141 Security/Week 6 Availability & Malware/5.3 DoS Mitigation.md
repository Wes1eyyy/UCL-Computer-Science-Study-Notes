# Week 5 – DoS Mitigation

## 1️⃣ Risk Management (风险管理)

- Continuous cycle of attack ↔ defense (攻击 ↔ 防御)
    
- Big players: Cloudflare, Akamai (专门做防御的大公司)
    

---

## 2️⃣ Client Puzzles (客户端谜题)

- Idea: Slow down attacker (拖慢攻击者)
    
- Solve moderately hard problem (中等难度问题)  
    → e.g., find X so LSBₙ(SHA-1(C || X)) = 0ⁿ
    
- Apply only during attack; easy to check solution.
    

### Examples:

- TCP connection floods (TCP连接洪水) → require puzzle in first packet
    
- SSL handshake DoS → solve puzzle before RSA decrypt
    

### Benefits:

- Adjustable hardness (可调难度)
    
- Lightweight check (轻量验证)
    

### Limitations:

- Requires changes on client & server (需客户端和服务器改动)
    
- Hurts low-power devices (影响低功耗设备)

## 3️⃣ Memory-bound Functions (内存绑定函数)

- CPU power ratio ≈ 8000 (high-end vs low-end)
    
- Memory access ratio ≈ 2 (更公平)
    
- Better puzzles → require many memory accesses.

## 4️⃣ CAPTCHAs (验证码)

- Idea: Verify human (确认人类)
    
- Use for app-layer DDoS (应用层攻击)
    
- Present CAPTCHA per IP; only process valid requests.
    

---

## 5️⃣ Source Identification (源头识别)

### 5a. Ingress Filtering (入口过滤)

- ISP filters out spoofed source IP (过滤伪造源IP)
    
- Problem: Needs global cooperation (全球合作)
    

### 5b. Traceback (回溯)

- Routers record path info (路由器记录路径信息)
    
- Assumptions: stable path, many packets, honest routers.
    

---

## Traceback Methods

### Simple:

- Write full path into packet (全路径写入包) → impractical.
    

### Better:

- Store one random link per packet (每包存一条链路)
    
- Use probabilistic marking (概率标记).
    

### Edge Sampling (链路采样):

- Fields: start, end, distance (起点，终点，距离)
    
- Coin toss: decide where to write.
    

### Where to store:

- Use 16-bit identification field in IP header.

## 📢 Take-home Message

✅ DoS attacks are real; must plan at design time.  
❌ Current Internet poorly equipped for DDoS.  
💡 Many research proposals exist, but core redesign is needed.
