# Usability vs. Security

![[Security vs usability.png]]

## Core Conflict
- **Secure ≠ Usable**  
- Over-secured systems become insecure through workarounds  

## Policy Pitfalls  
- Overly complex rules  
- Unclear risk communication  
- Conflicts with user workflows  

## Unintentional Failures  
- **Human error**: Mistakes happen  
- **Non-compliance**(不合规 / 未遵守规定): Productivity > Security  
- Causes:  
  - Poor risk intuition  
  - Complex devices  
  - Security obstructs tasks  

## Hidden Costs  
- False designer assumptions:  
  1. Users prioritize security  
  2. **Time** for security tasks exists  
  3. Training solves non-compliance
