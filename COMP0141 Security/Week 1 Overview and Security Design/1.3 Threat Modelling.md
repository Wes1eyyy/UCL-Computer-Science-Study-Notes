# Security Policy address

## Core Components  
- **Threats**: Potential harm (e.g., hackers, malware)  
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses exploited by threats (e.g., unpatched software)  
- **Likelihood**: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability  
- **Impact**: Potential damage or consequences  
- **Protection**: Mitigation strategies (e.g., firewalls, encryption)  
## Risk Formula  
`Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact`

# Adversary Resources & Attacks

## Adversary Capabilities
- **Observe**: Network traffic, system behavior  
- **Corrupt**: Routers, databases, logs  
- **Influence**: Configs, user decisions  
- **Modify**: Packets, stored data  
- **Control**: Employees, IoT devices  

## Attack Definition  
- Series of actions violating security policy  

## Strategic Adversary  
- Optimizes resource use for:  
  - Maximum impact  
  - Minimal detection  
  - Lowest cost  


# STRIDE Threat Model

## Core Threats
- Spoofing(伪装): Fake identity (e.g., stolen login)
- Tampering(篡改): Data alteration (e.g., balance change)
- Repudiation(否认): Denying actions (e.g., unsigned transactions)
- Info disclosure(信息泄露): Data leaks (e.g., account numbers)
- Denial of service(拒绝服务): DoS (e.g., overload systems)
- Elevation of privilege(权限提升): Unauthorized access (e.g., admin rights)

## Banking Example
| Threat       | Banking Scenario                |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Spoofing     | ATM card cloning                |
| Tampering    | Altering transaction amounts   |
| Repudiation  | "I didn't transfer that money" |
| Info Disclosure | Customer data breach          |
| DoS          | Overloading online banking     |
| Elevation    | Teller accessing CEO accounts  |
