# Week 9+: Security in Web 🌐

## Web Architecture
- Browser sends **request** → server sends **response** → browser **renders HTML**.
- Why request?
  - User types URL / clicks link / reloads page.
  - Server issues redirect.
  - Page embeds another page.
  - Script on page sends request.
- How server responds?
  - Return static file (HTML, CSS).
  - Run script + return output (PHP, Python).
  - Use plugin.

## Web Server
- Static content: HTML + CSS.
- Dynamic content:
  - CGI (e.g., PHP, Python).
  - Server modules (e.g., Rails).
  - Database backend (SQL).

## Threat Model
- Is the server trusted by browser/user?
- Is the user trusted by server/browser?
- Is the browser trusted by user/server?
- Is someone eavesdropping on the traffic?

## Example Concepts
- **Cookies** (小饼干): stored in browser, can be modified.
- **Session** (会话): server-side user state, can be hijacked.
- **Input** (输入): user-provided data, can inject malicious code.
