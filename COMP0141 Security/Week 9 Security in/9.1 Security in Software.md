## Week 9+: Security in Software

### When is a program secure?

- It does exactly what it **should** (应做的事), no more, no less.
    
- We must know what it should do:
    
    - Defined by someone we trust? (信任来源)
        
    - Defined by ourselves? (自己写代码？)
        
- Secure if it avoids:
    
    - Crashing system (崩溃系统)
        
    - Deleting/corrupting important files (破坏重要文件)
        
    - Sending passwords over internet (泄漏密码)
        
- But: what if it **could** do bad things?

### Unintended Functionality

- **Exploit** (利用) = attacker triggers unintended behavior.
    
- Security = understanding both intended & unintended functionalities.

### What makes security special?

- **Correctness** (正确性): right output for input.
    
- **Safety** (安全性): no bad outputs, no matter input.
    
- **Robustness** (鲁棒性): can handle errors.
    
- Must hold even with smart, strategic attackers (有策略的对手)!

### Example: strcpy

- Buffer overflow (缓冲区溢出): too long input overwrites adjacent memory.
    
- Can change program behavior, break security.

### Morris Worm

- First internet worm (1988), accidental.
    
- Caused massive internet reboot.
    

---

### Worms

- Spread fast, autonomously (自动传播), exploiting vulnerabilities.
    
- Example: Slammer worm infected 75,000 hosts in 10 minutes.
