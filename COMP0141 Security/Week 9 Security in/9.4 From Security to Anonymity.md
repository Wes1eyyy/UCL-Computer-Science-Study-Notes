# 🕶️ Week 9.4: From Security to Anonymity(匿名)

## 🌐 Encrypted Web Traffic
- **HTTPS** (超文本安全协议): hides content, but **IP addresses** (IP地址) still visible.
- **Tor** (洋葱路由): hides both content & routing, using layered encryption.

---

## 🧅 Tor (The Onion Router)
- Works by **layered encryption** (分层加密), like peeling an onion.
- Each **relay** (中继节点) removes one layer; only exit node sees the final message.
- Sender and receiver stay anonymous.

---

## 🔍 How Tor Works
1️⃣ Alice’s client gets **relay list** (中继列表) from directory server.  
2️⃣ Chooses a random **path** (路径) through relays.  
3️⃣ Encrypts messages in layers; each relay peels one.

## ❓ Common Questions
- Q: How to block Tor users?  
  A: Block **exit nodes** (出口节点).

- Q: Does Tor hide web content?  
  A: No, only routing; use **HTTPS** for content privacy.

- Q: Does Tor access normal sites anonymously?  
  A: Yes, but **hidden services** (隐藏服务) exist only inside Tor.

## 🕵️ Tor Hidden Services
- Special `.onion` sites only accessible inside Tor.
- Both user and server identities hidden.

## 🗝️ Core Concepts
- **Anonymity** (匿名性): hiding who sends or receives.
- **Encryption** (加密): making content unreadable without key.
- **Routing** (路由): the path taken through the network.
- **Exit Node** (出口节点): final relay that connects to destination.
- **Hidden Services** (隐藏服务): fully anonymous sites inside Tor.
