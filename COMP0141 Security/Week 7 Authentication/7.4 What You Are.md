## ✅ What You Are – Biometrics Summary

### Core Idea

- Authenticate using **what you are** (你是谁)
    
- Example: fingerprints, iris, face, voice, gait, signature
    

---

### Biometrics Concepts

- **Biometric sample** (生物样本): raw data from capture
    
- **Biometric template** (生物模板): stored extracted features
    
- Needs: distinguishing (可区分), repeatable (可重复)
    

---

### Storage Process

1️⃣ Enrolment phase (注册阶段): capture + store digital features  
2️⃣ Authentication phase (认证阶段): capture + match against template

### Challenges & Devices

|Challenge|Fingerprint scanner (指纹)|Hand scanner (手掌)|
|---|---|---|
|Usable? (可用性)|okay|good|
|Maintainable? (可维护)|okay|good|
|Match closeness? (匹配)|good|okay|
|Feature stability? (稳定)|good|good|

Notes:

- Fingerprints: check “liveness” (活性)
    
- Hand: harder to train (训练)

### Technical Pros & Cons

✅ Advantages (优点)

- Nothing to remember (不用记)
    
- Passive (被动)
    
- Can’t share (不能共享)
    
- Unique (唯一性)
    

❌ Disadvantages (缺点)

- Hard to revoke (难撤销)
    
- Invasive (侵入式)
    
- Private ≠ secret (可被偷)
    
- Birthday paradox (误识率风险)
    

---

### User Acceptance

- Privacy (隐私): who uses data, for what?
    
- Reliability (可靠性): can attackers bypass?
    

---

### CAPTCHA

- Test: are you human or bot?
    
- Pros: blocks bots
    
- Cons: may block humans too
    

---

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Combine:
    
    - What you know (你知道的)
        
    - What you have (你拥有的)
        
    - What you are (你是谁)
        
- Stronger security by combining factors

如果你要背口诀，可以用：

> Biometrics = unique + passive + privacy risk  
> CAPTCHA = block bots, maybe humans  
> MFA = combine factors for best security
