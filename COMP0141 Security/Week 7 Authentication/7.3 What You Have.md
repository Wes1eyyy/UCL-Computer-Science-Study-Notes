## 🏷️ Authentication – What You Have

### ✅ Core Idea

- Based on **physical/digital objects** you own (e.g., keycards, tokens).
    

---

### 🔐 Challenge-Response (挑战-应答)

- Server sends random challenge (随机数).
    
- Client encrypts challenge with shared key → sends back response.
    
- Server verifies decrypted result.
    

✅ Prevents replay attacks (重放攻击).

---

### ❌ Why Not Just MAC?

- Computing MAC (消息认证码) needs resources.
    
- Lightweight devices may lack power → challenge-response is simpler.
    

---

### ⚠ Don’t Roll Your Own Crypto

- Custom protocols often miss attacker models (攻击者模型).
    
- Always use tested, standard cryptographic designs.
    

---

### ⏲️ One-Time Passwords (一次性密码)

- Generated per session → **used only once**.
    
- Can be:
    
    - Time-based (基于时间, needs sync).
        
    - Counter-based (数学公式, no sync).
        

---

### 🔄 Hash Chains (散列链)

- Compute H(w), H(H(w)), H(H(H(w)))...
    
- Each login sends Hᵗ(w), next time Hᵗ⁻¹(w), etc.
    
- Relies on **pre-image resistance** (前像抗性):
    
    - Given h, hard to find m such that H(m) = h.

### Summary Table

|Method|Strength|
|---|---|
|Challenge-Response|Lightweight, no replay.|
|One-Time Password|Fresh codes, old ones useless.|
|Hash Chains|Math-secured, one-time use per step.|
