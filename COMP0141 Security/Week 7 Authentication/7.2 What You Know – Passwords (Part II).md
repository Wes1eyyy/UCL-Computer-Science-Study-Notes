## Week 7 – Authentication (Part II)

### Unix Passwords

- Stored in `/etc/passwd`
    
- Use **hashing** (哈希) → store H(password), not plain password
    
- **Hash function** (哈希函数) properties:
    
    - One-way (单向): hard to reverse
        
    - No faster algorithm than brute-force

### Old-School Unix Passwords

- Use **DES** (对称加密算法) as hash
    
    - Encrypt null string with password as key
        
    - Truncate to 8 chars
        
    - Slowdown: run DES 25 times
        
- Problem: passwords are not truly random
    
    - Space ≈ 6×10¹⁵, but humans use ~1 million common passwords

### Salting (加盐)

- Store in `/etc/shadow`: `username:$ID$salt$hash`
    
    - ID → encryption method (e.g., SHA-512)
        
    - Salt → random value, unique per user
        
    - Hash → H(salt || password)
        
- With salt: attacker must recompute hash per salt-password pair
    
- Without salt: attacker can precompute dictionary once

### Graphical Passwords (图形密码)

- Use patterns, gestures, or PINs
    
- Easy to memorize, but can leak via observation (shoulder surfing)
    

---

### Security Questions (安全问题)

- Backup if password is forgotten
    
- Often weak: answers can be guessed or found online
    

---

### Coercion Attacks (橡皮管攻击)

- Physical force to extract password (e.g., threats, torture)
    
- Bypass cryptography completely
    

---

### Coping Strategies

- System wants: different, long, random, regularly changed passwords
    
- Users do: reuse passwords, add “123”, write down, use reset
    

---

### Password Usability vs. Security

- Security: long + random
    
- Usability: humans can’t generate or remember these
    
- Balance is key!
