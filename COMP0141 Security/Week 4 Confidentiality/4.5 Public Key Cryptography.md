### ✅ Public-Key Encryption (公钥加密)

- `KeyGen()` → (pk, sk)
    
- Encryption: `c = Enc(pk, m)`
    
- Decryption: `m = Dec(sk, c)`
    
- Anyone can encrypt with `pk`, only owner can decrypt with `sk`
    

---

### ⚠️ Threat Model (威胁模型)

**Goals of attacker:**

- Recover `sk` → get all messages
    
- Recover specific plaintext
    
- Distinguish plaintext (learn 1 bit)
    

**Capabilities:**

- Known ciphertext
    
- Known encryption algorithm
    
- Known plaintext
    
- Chosen plaintext
    
- Chosen ciphertext

### 🔒 IND-CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack 安全性)

- Attacker cannot distinguish between two plaintexts, given only their ciphertexts.
    

### 🔐 IND-CCA (Chosen Ciphertext Attack 安全性)

- Even if attacker can decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts, cannot break security of unseen ciphertext.

## 🧮 RSA Encryption (教材版)

### ✅ RSA KeyGen

1. Choose large primes `p`, `q`
    
2. Set `N = p * q`
    
3. Choose `e`, coprime to φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
    
4. Compute `d = e⁻¹ mod φ(N)`
    
5. Public key: `(N, e)`, Private key: `(N, d)`
    

### ✅ RSA Usage

- Encrypt: `c = m^e mod N`
    
- Decrypt: `m = c^d mod N`
    

---

### ❗ Security of RSA

- If attacker factors `N`, they can get φ(N) → break RSA
    
- "Textbook RSA" is **not IND-CPA/IND-CCA** secure (too deterministic)
    
- Real-world usage: **RSA-OAEP** padding

### 💣 Message Recovery Attack

1. Compute `C_r = c * r^e mod N`
    
2. Decrypt: `m_r = C_r^d mod N`
    
3. Get `m = m_r * r⁻¹ mod N`
