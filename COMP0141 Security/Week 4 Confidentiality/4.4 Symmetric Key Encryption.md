## 🔑 Asymmetric (Public-Key) Encryption

### 📌 Core Concepts

- **Public Key (公钥)**: shared openly
    
- **Private Key (私钥)**: kept secret
    
- **Encrypt with public key**, decrypt with private key
    

### ✅ Advantages

- No pre-shared key needed (无需共享密钥)
    
- Scales well for many users (适用于大规模通信)
    
- Enables **digital signatures** (数字签名)
    

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Slower than symmetric encryption (比对称加密慢)
    
- Vulnerable to **Man-in-the-Middle** if keys aren't authenticated (中间人攻击)

## 🔐 RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

- Based on factoring large primes
    
- Public key = (N = p·q, e)
    
- Private key = d (such that ed≡1mod  φ(N)ed ≡ 1 \mod φ(N))
    
- Encryption: c=memod  Nc = m^e \mod N
    
- Decryption: m=cdmod  Nm = c^d \mod N

## 📦 Application

- Use RSA to encrypt a **symmetric key**, then use that key with AES (or others) to encrypt data
    
- Used in HTTPS (web security)
