## 🔐 Authenticating Bob (身份认证)

### Problem:
- How does Alice know it’s really Bob, not an attacker?

### Solution: Digital Certificates (数字证书)

- Bob has a certificate signed by a trusted CA (Certificate Authority).
- The certificate says: "This public key belongs to bob.com".
- Alice's browser verifies the CA’s signature.

### Steps:
1. Bob sends his public key + certificate.
2. Browser verifies the certificate with built-in CA public keys.
3. If valid → trust that key belongs to bob.com.
4. Use that key to encrypt session key.

### Attack Prevention:
- Fake Bob has no valid certificate → browser warns user.
- Prevents man-in-the-middle (中间人攻击).

### Key idea to remember:
> **Authentication via certificates signed by trusted authorities.**
