## 🔐 Confidentiality (保密性)
- Goal: Keep data private.
- Core Questions:
  - How to communicate secretly?
  - How to establish a secure communication basis?

## 🧠 Terminology (术语)
- **Cryptographer (密码学家)**: Designs cryptographic systems.
- **Cryptanalyst (密码分析师)**: Attempts to break them.
- **Code (代码)**: Semantic translation (e.g. A = B).
- **Ciphertext (密文)**: Encrypted form of a **plaintext (明文)** message.

## ❗ Important Warnings
- **Never design your own cryptography** without formal training.
- This is an *introductory* course—understand **what** cryptography offers, not how to build it.
- Cryptography assumes a **binary** view: either secure or insecure (based on assumptions).

## 🏛 Caesar Cipher (凯撒密码)
- Monoalphabetic shift cipher.
- Rotate alphabet by a fixed **key** (e.g. key = 3 → A → D).
- Weak to **frequency analysis**.

## 🔄 Monoalphabetic Substitution (单表替代密码)
- Each letter is replaced by a fixed symbol or letter.
- Caesar cipher is a subset: `π(x) = x + key mod 26`.

## 🎯 Threat Model (威胁模型)
### Motivation:
- **Key Recovery (密钥恢复)**: Learn future plaintexts.
- **Plaintext Recovery (明文恢复)**: Learn a specific message.
- **Distinguish Plaintext**: Learn any information (even 1 bit).

### Capabilities:
- Known ciphertext (已知密文)
- Known algorithm (已知算法)
- Known plaintext (已知明文)
- Chosen plaintext (选定明文)
- Chosen ciphertext (选定密文)

## 📊 Frequency Analysis (频率分析)
- English: 'e' most common.
- Used to break monoalphabetic ciphers.
- Example: encrypted sentence decoded by analyzing letter frequency → "It was the best of times..."
