# Week 8 – Access Control

## 🔑 Access Control (访问控制)
- Control who (subject 用户) can access what (object 对象) with which rights (access rights 权限).

## 🌟 Core Concepts
- Reference Monitor (参考监视器): checks request, rights, grants/denies.
- Access Control Matrix (访问控制矩阵): table mapping subjects ↔ objects ↔ rights.
- Access Control List / ACL (访问控制列表): per-object list of allowed subjects + rights.

## 🏷 Access Rights (访问权限)
- Read (r 读): view contents.
- Write (w 写): modify contents.
- Execute (x 执行): run as program.

## 🖥 UNIX Permissions (UNIX 权限)
- Three parts: owner (拥有者), group (组), others (其他人).
- Example: rwxr-xr-- → owner (rwx), group (r-x), others (r--).

## ⚙️ Special Users
- Root (超级用户): has all system permissions.
- Use sudo (切换超级用户) carefully!

## 🧲 Sticky Bit (粘滞位)
- Allows only owner/root to delete/rename files in a shared directory.

## 📋 Types of Access Control
- Mandatory (强制访问控制): based on fixed rules.
- Discretionary (自主访问控制): based on owner’s choices.
- Role-based (基于角色访问控制): based on user roles.

## 💻 Example Check
- Who can access file?
    - Check owner rights.
    - Check group rights.
    - Check others rights.
