## 🐧 Week 8.3 — Unix Processes

### 📦 Processes

- Processes are isolated (隔离).
    
- Run under user’s `uid` (用户ID).
    
- Can access user’s files and permissions.
    
- Root (`uid=0`) can drop privileges to a lower `uid`.

### 🏷️ Process User IDs

- **EUID** (Effective UID, 有效用户ID): decides permissions.
    
- **RUID** (Real UID, 真实用户ID): who started the process.
    
- **SUID** (Saved UID, 保存的用户ID): EUID before changes.
    

---

### 🔄 Changing User IDs

- Root can change EUID / RUID / SUID freely.
    
- Unprivileged users can change EUID ↔ RUID or SUID.
    
- `setuid(x)` → change all to x.
    
- `seteuid(x)` → change only EUID.

### 🚀 Elevating Privileges

- Example: `passwd` modifies `/etc/shadow` (root-only).
    
- Use **setuid bit** (setuid 位, 提权位): executable runs with file owner’s permissions (e.g., root).
    

---

### 🔑 SETUID Bit

- If set, executable runs as file owner (EUID = owner).
    
- Example: `/usr/bin/sudo`.
    
- Risk: setuid programs can be exploited if vulnerable.

### 🏰 Privileges

- Pros:  
    ✅ Simple, protects most cases.  
    ✅ Flexible for many policies.
    
- Cons:  
    ❌ ACLs coarse-grained.  
    ❌ Hard to separate same-user processes.  
    ❌ Many ops need root.

### 🔐 Permissions (过去 vs. 现在)

- Past: centralized mainframe, many users, shared system.
    
- Present: distributed personal devices, users manage own permissions.
