## 🛡️ Access Control – Design Principles (设计原则)

- **Least privilege** (最小权限): Give only minimal needed rights.
    
- **Separation of responsibilities** (职责分离): Split critical tasks across roles.
    
- **Complete mediation** (完全中介): Check every access, every time.
    
- **Fail-safe default** (安全默认): Deny by default, allow only if permitted.
    
- **Defence in depth** (纵深防御): Use multiple security layers.
    
- **Open design** (开放设计): Security does not depend on secrecy.
    
- **Psychological acceptability** (心理可接受性): Make security usable and user-friendly.
    
- **Economy of mechanisms** (机制简约): Keep systems simple to reduce risks.

## 🔑 Trusted Computing Base (TCB, 可信计算基)

- TCB: Small, essential components (hardware/software) that enforce security.
    
- Keep TCB small (越小越好) to minimize attack surface.
