# Week 8.4: Types of Access Control

## Core Terms
- **Subject** (主体): user or process  
- **Object** (对象): resource (e.g., file, photo)  
- **Rights** (权限): actions (view, tag, auth)

---

## Access Control Policies
- **MAC** (Mandatory Access Control, 强制访问控制): system assigns permissions.
- **DAC** (Discretionary Access Control, 自主访问控制): owner sets permissions.

---

## Graham-Denning Model
Operations on rights:
1. Delete object (删除对象)
2. Delete subject (删除主体)
3. Grant right (授予权限)
4. Transfer right (转移权限)
5. Revoke right (撤销权限)
6. Check right (检查权限)

Reference Monitor (参考监视器) ensures correct operations.

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control, 基于角色的访问控制)
- Use roles, not users, to manage permissions.
- Scalable (可扩展), fewer mistakes.
- Example: UNIX permissions (owner, group, world).
- Key idea: people change, roles stay.

---

## Access Control in Organizations
Ensure:
- No gaps (无缺口)
- No conflicts (无冲突)
- No unintended restrictions (无意外限制)

Watch for:
- Information asymmetry (信息不对称) between admins and owners.
